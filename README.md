# Code_Stego
- Code_Stego implements a Steganography algorithm to save source code into Image of
the styled code snippet.
- Code_Stego is the project made by The Magic Methods team, for Python Discord Code Jam 2023

![Explanation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StoneSteel27/The-Magic-Methods/main/doc_images/code_stego.png)

A Code_Stego Demo Website: [Code_Stego](https://codestego.up.railway.app/stego/).

Invite our Discord Bot for testing the functionalities : [Invite Bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1148263715771273278&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## Features
- Code snippet Images generated by Code_Stego, would contain the source code within itself.
- This could help lots of people to view thier code easily, with code highlighting.
- Posting thier highlighted code in internet would be made much easier, and there is no character limit for images

## Implementations
For displaying Code_Stego's reliability, this project has 3 implementations within it:
- A Python Module
- Django website
- A Discord Bot
