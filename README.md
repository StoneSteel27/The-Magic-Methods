# Code_Stego
- Code_Stego implements a Steganography algorithm to save source code into Image of
the styled code snippet.
- Code_Stego is the project made by The Magic Methods team, for Python Discord Code Jam 2023

A Code_Stego Demo Website: [Code_Stego](https://codestego.up.railway.app/)

## Features
Your code snippet can be shared anywhere, and the image would contain the source code within itself. This would be a lot of help for others, and save them a lot of time, if they want to retype the code by themselves.

## Implementations
This project has 3 implementations within it:
- A Python Module
- Django website
- A Discord Bot
